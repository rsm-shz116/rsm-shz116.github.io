    "text": "Dean Karlan at Yale and John List at the University of Chicago conducted a field experiment to test the effectiveness of different fundraising letters. They sent out 50,000 fundraising letters to potential donors, randomly assigning each letter to one of three treatments: a standard letter, a matching grant letter, or a challenge grant letter. They published the results of this experiment in the American Economic Review in 2007. The article and supporting data are available from the AEA website and from Innovations for Poverty Action as part of Harvard’s Dataverse.\nThe study found that mentioning a matching grant increased both the probability of donation and the amount given, but increasing the match ratio beyond $1:1 did not further increase giving. These results suggest that the presence of a match signal matters more than its magnitude. Interestingly, the effect was stronger in politically conservative (“red”) states, suggesting that local context may influence the impact of fundraising appeals.\nThis project seeks to replicate their results."

Each row represents a potential donor who received a fundraising letter as part of the experiment. The primary treatment variable (treatment) indicates whether the recipient was offered a matching grant, while the ratio variable specifies the match rate ($1:$1, $2:$1, or $3:$1). About 67% of participants received a match treatment, evenly split across the three match ratios. The dataset also includes variations in the maximum match amount (size) and suggested donation levels (ask1, ask2, ask3). Key outcome variables include whether a donation was made (gave) and the donation amount (amount), which has a highly skewed distribution with a mean of $0.92 and a maximum of $400. Additional variables describe donor giving history (e.g., hpa for highest previous amount), demographics (e.g., female, couple), and ZIP-level census attributes such as income, education, and urbanization. Political context is captured by indicators like redcty, bluecty, and perbush, allowing for analysis of heterogeneous treatment effects by political leaning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Definitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ntreatment\nTreatment\n\n\ncontrol\nControl\n\n\nratio\nMatch ratio\n\n\nratio2\n2:1 match ratio\n\n\nratio3\n3:1 match ratio\n\n\nsize\nMatch threshold\n\n\nsize25\n$25,000 match threshold\n\n\nsize50\n$50,000 match threshold\n\n\nsize100\n$100,000 match threshold\n\n\nsizeno\nUnstated match threshold\n\n\nask\nSuggested donation amount\n\n\naskd1\nSuggested donation was highest previous contribution\n\n\naskd2\nSuggested donation was 1.25 x highest previous contribution\n\n\naskd3\nSuggested donation was 1.50 x highest previous contribution\n\n\nask1\nHighest previous contribution (for suggestion)\n\n\nask2\n1.25 x highest previous contribution (for suggestion)\n\n\nask3\n1.50 x highest previous contribution (for suggestion)\n\n\namount\nDollars given\n\n\ngave\nGave anything\n\n\namountchange\nChange in amount given\n\n\nhpa\nHighest previous contribution\n\n\nltmedmra\nSmall prior donor: last gift was less than median $35\n\n\nfreq\nNumber of prior donations\n\n\nyears\nNumber of years since initial donation\n\n\nyear5\nAt least 5 years since initial donation\n\n\nmrm2\nNumber of months since last donation\n\n\ndormant\nAlready donated in 2005\n\n\nfemale\nFemale\n\n\ncouple\nCouple\n\n\nstate50one\nState tag: 1 for one observation of each of 50 states;

For example, the average highest previous donation (hpa) is $59.60 in the treatment group and $58.96 in the control group. The share of females is 27.5% in the treatment group and 28.3% in the control group. These differences are minimal and consistent with what we’d expect from random assignment.\nTo formally test for balance, I computed t-statistics both manually and using linear regressions with treatment status as the dependent variable. The t-values are small across the board, and none of the variables have statistically significant differences at conventional levels (all p-values &gt; 0.05). The closest case is the female variable with a t-statistic of -1.76 and a p-value of 0.079, which is still above the standard 5% threshold.\nThese results align closely with Table 1 in Karlan and List (2007), where they also demonstrate covariate balance between treatment arms. This reassures me that the randomization was implemented properly, and any differences in donation outcomes between groups can be interpreted as causal effects of the treatment."

The response rate was 2.2% for the treatment group compared to 1.8% in the control group. Next, I estimated a simple linear probability model where the outcome was whether someone donated (gave), and the only predictor was whether they were in the treatment group. The regression shows that being in the treatment group increased the probability of giving by 0.48 percentage points, and this difference is statistically significant (p = 0.0019). The corresponding t-statistic (3.2) confirms this effect is unlikely to have occurred by chance.\nIn more intuitive terms: people who received a fundraising letter with a matching grant offer were modestly but significantly more likely to donate. Interestingly, although more people donated in the treatment group, the average donation amount among those who gave was slightly lower ($43.87 vs. $45.54). This suggests that the match offer encouraged more people to participate, possibly including those who were willing to give smaller amounts.\ntodo: run a probit regression where the outcome variable is whether any charitable donation was made and the explanatory variable is assignment to treatment or control.

To make the probit model easier to interpret, I calculated the Average Marginal Effect (AME) of treatment: AME = 0.0043, This means that offering a matched donation increases the probability of giving by about 0.43 percentage points, on average, holding everything else constant. The result is statistically significant.\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\n\n# Filter for treatment groups only (exclude control)\ndf_treat &lt;- df %&gt;% filter(treatment == 1)\n\n# Make sure ratio is a factor for grouping\ndf_treat &lt;- df_treat %&gt;% mutate(ratio = as.character(ratio))\n\n# 1.

Despite increasing the match rate from $1:$1 to $2:$1 or $3:$1, donation rates did not increase, supporting their argument that the presence of a match matters more than the size of the match.\nIn behavioral terms, it suggests that what motivates people to give is not necessarily the economic value of the match—but rather the signal that someone else is matching at all. Once that social or psychological nudge is activated, increasing the ratio does not seem to matter.\n\nmodel_ratio &lt;- lm(gave ~ factor(ratio), data = df %&gt;% filter(treatment == 1))\nsummary(model_ratio)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = gave ~ factor(ratio), data = df %&gt;% filter(treatment == \n    1))\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.02273 -0.02273 -0.02263 -0.02075  0.97925 \n\nCoefficients:\n               Estimate Std.

So, about 2.07% of individuals donated in the $1:$1 condition.\nratio2 (0.001884): This is the additional effect of receiving a $2:$1 match compared to $1:$1. The donation rate is estimated to be 0.19 percentage points higher, but this is not statistically significant (p = 0.338).\nratio3 (0.001984): Similarly, this is the estimated increase in giving under a $3:$1 match vs. $1:$1. Again, the increase is about 0.20 percentage points, but not statistically significant (p = 0.313).\nAll p-values are well above 0.05, meaning the differences between match ratios are not statistically significant. The R-squared is essentially zero (~0.00004), indicating that match ratio explains virtually none of the variation in giving behavior among those offered any match. The standard errors (~0.002) are large relative to the size of the estimated effects (~0.002), meaning we lack the precision needed to distinguish these effects from zero.\n\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n\n# Calculate raw response rates for each match ratio\ndf %&gt;%\n  filter(ratio %in% c(\"1\", \"2\", \"3\")) %&gt;%\n  group_by(ratio) %&gt;%\n  summarise(response_rate = mean(gave, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = ratio, values_from = response_rate) -&gt; rate_table\n\n# Calculate differences\ndiff_2_vs_1 &lt;- rate_table$`2` - rate_table$`1`\ndiff_3_vs_2 &lt;- rate_table$`3` - rate_table$`2`\n\ncat(\"Response rate difference (2:1 vs 1:1):\", round(diff_2_vs_1, 4), \"\\n\")\n\nResponse rate difference (2:1 vs 1:1): 0.0019 \n\ncat(\"Response rate difference (3:1 vs 2:1):\", round(diff_3_vs_2, 4), \"\\n\")\n\nResponse rate difference (3:1 vs 2:1): 1e-04 \n\n\n\ncoef_table &lt;- summary(model_ratio)$coefficients\n\n# Extract coefficients\ncoef_1_1 &lt;- coef_table[\"(Intercept)\", \"Estimate\"]\ncoef_2_1 &lt;- coef_table[\"factor(ratio)2\", \"Estimate\"]\ncoef_3_1 &lt;- coef_table[\"factor(ratio)3\", \"Estimate\"]\n\n# Differences between fitted values\nfitted_2_vs_1 &lt;- coef_2_1\nfitted_3_vs_2 &lt;- coef_3_1 - coef_2_1\n\ncat(\"Fitted response rate difference (2:1 vs 1:1):\", round(fitted_2_vs_1, 4), \"\\n\")\n\nFitted response rate difference (2:1 vs 1:1): 0.0019 \n\ncat(\"Fitted response rate difference (3:1 vs 2:1):\", round(fitted_3_vs_2, 4), \"\\n\")\n\nFitted response rate difference (3:1 vs 2:1): 1e-04 \n\n\nBoth approaches yield the same values: - 2:1 vs 1:1 difference: +0.0019 (or 0.19 percentage points) - 3:1 vs 2:1 difference: +0.0001 (or 0.01 percentage points) These differences are very small, and as confirmed by previous t-tests and regression output, they are not statistically significant.\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\n\n# Run linear regression on amount\nmodel_amount_ratio &lt;- lm(amount ~ ratio, data = df_treat)\nsummary(model_amount_ratio)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = amount ~ ratio, data = df_treat)\n\nResiduals:\n   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n -1.03  -1.03  -0.94  -0.94 399.06 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

The R-squared is nearly zero, which confirms that the match ratio explains virtually none of the variation in how much people donated.

The true effect is tiny (0.004), and the distribution is very spread out. Zero appears near the center, suggesting that with such a small sample size, it is easily fail to detect the true positive effect.\nSample size = 200: The distribution narrows, but still shows a good deal of spread. Zero is still roughly in the center, which again means there’s a high chance we wouldn’t reject the null in a real experiment of this size.\nSample size = 500: The distribution is now visibly tighter, with more concentration around a slightly positive mean. Zero is no longer the exact center, but it is still well within the bulk of the distribution—indicating marginal power to detect small effects.\nSample size = 1000: The distribution is narrower and more symmetric, and zero is near the edge of the central mass, moving toward the tail. This suggests that with 1,000 observations per group, it is possible to have enough precision to see that the true difference is not zero, even though the effect is small.\nAs sample size increases, the distribution of sample means becomes more normal and concentrated. With small samples, the sampling distribution is wide, and zero is in the center, meaning it’s hard to detect small effects. As sample size grows, the distribution tightens, and zero moves toward the tail—reflecting increasing power to detect a true positive effect."
